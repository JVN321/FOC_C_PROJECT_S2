    <div class="description">
        <p>
            This portal is designed to streamline the process of submitting and managing complaints and feedback across various areas within our institution. Whether you're addressing issues related to the campus or hostel, our goal is to ensure that your voice is heard and acted upon promptly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Developed with user experience in mind, the system is intuitive and secure, allowing students and staff to report concerns or share suggestions anonymously if they wish. It serves as a bridge between the administration and the campus community to foster transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            We value your input. Letâ€™s work together to create a better environment for everyone at MITS.
